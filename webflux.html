            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In this post we will show how to write a REST microservice using reactive programming with Sprint Web Flux as an alternative to Spring Web MVC.

            <h2>Reactive Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Before start, it's important to explain what reactive programming means.
                Succinctly: reactive programming is programming paradigm oriented to data stream and propagation of changes (asynchronous).
            </p>
            <p>
                An easy way to understand propagation of changes is to remember who a excel formula works: everytime one of its reffered cells are
                changed, the value is updated. That behaviour resembles to the design pattern Observer introduced by the famous Gang of Four book called 
                <i>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</i>.
            </p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Observer_w_update.svg/854px-Observer_w_update.svg.png"/>
            <p>
                In the picture above we can see that the Subject possess information being watched by the Observers.
                These observers register themselves to receive notifications of changes in the Subject when it suffers a change of state.
                Upon being notified, the Observers will perform some operation for which they have been programmed. That's where the propagation of changes happen.
            </p>
            <h3>Main features</h3>
            <p>
                When talking about reactive programming there are some essentials features worth mentioning such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Streams:</strong> sequences of events ordered in a temporal way and can be manifested in several ways, for example: parts of a
                     file being downloaded, mouse cursor positions, twitter feed, RESTful service calls, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Asyncronous:</strong> 
                    events are captured asynchronously, a function is defined to be performed when one event is issued, another is set to when an error is issued 
                    and another to when a completion event is issued.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Non-blocking:</strong> a blocking code will stop and wait for more data (disk read, network, etc), however the non-blocking 
                    code will process the available data, request to be notified when more data is available and then continue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Backpressure:</strong> the subscriber's ability to limit data
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Failures as Messages:</strong> exceptions should not be thrown in the traditional way. In fact, they must be processed by a 
                    handler function.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Four pillars</h3>
            <p>
                Reactive programming is build upon four pillars: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Responsive: A responsive system is quick to react to all users — under blue skies and grey skies — 
                        in order to ensure a consistently positive user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Resilient: A scalable system is easily upgraded on demand in order to ensure responsiveness under various load conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scalable: A resilient system applies proper design and architecture principles in order to ensure responsiveness under grey 
                        skies as well as blue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Message-driven: A message-driven application may be event-driven, actor-based (directed messages), or a combination of the 
                        two. The main difference between messages and events is that messages are directed while events happen.
                        Messages have a clear destination while events may be observed by zero or more (0-N) observers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Reactive Streams API</h2>
            <p>
                Spring Framework 5 introduces the React Streams API to create a pattern for processing streams asynchronously with non-blocking return pressure.
                Reactive Streams started in 2013 by engineers from Netflix, Pivotal, Lightbend (formerly Typesafe), Red Hat, Twitter and Oracle.
                The Reactive Streams API defines 4 interfaces: Publisher, Subscriber, Subscription and Processor.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Publisher:</strong><br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/a399fae1030f9f296f324fffcab40009.js"></script>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscriber:</strong><br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/14c1fc8c5c852357edb3fcf19952c4c4.js"></script>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscription:</strong><br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/68f5e53609a95674f237517c36b16b6d.js"></script>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Processor:</strong><br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/729d8c02783a062167eb5ac3bac185c5.js"></script>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Spring WebFlux</h2>
            <p>
                
                It is the support module for reactive programming in the Spring Framework's web layer. One of the most interesting things about this module is 
                that even though the architecture behind it is quite different from the conventional Spring MVC, it offers an alternative to use it taking 
                advantage of some of the most relevant Spring MVC features: the annotations @Controller and @RequestMapping. We can see this in the following image:
            </p>
            <img src="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/images/webflux-overview.png"/>
            <p>
                In addition to the alternative mentioned above, Spring WebFlux also offers Router Functions to map controllers and endpoints. However, this alternative will not be presented in this post.
            </p>
            <h3> Spring Reactive Types</h3>
            <p>
                Spring Framework 5 introduces two new publisher reactive types: Mono and Flux. 
                While Mono is a publisher with zero or one element in the data stream, Flux is a publisher with zero or many elements in the data stream.
            </p>
        <section>
            <h2>Spring MVC vs Spring WebFlux</h2>
            <p>
                Now let's see the difference between a REST CRUD service implemented with Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.
                In order to show this difference, we are going to show how to implement three layers in both modules: Repository, Service and Controller.
            </p>
            <h3>Repository</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Spring MVC:<br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/ca6e61f28c5f10764f7db8798c1dbb85.js"> </script>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spring WebFlux:<br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/fcd75c1fa73923c64c3295277861049b.js"> </script>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
                The difference here is merely extends from ReactiveMongoRepository instead of MongoRepository.
            </p>
            <h3>Service</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    Spring MVC:<br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/02bdc5cb4e4675f3890dfff4a25644b3.js"> </script>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spring WebFlux:<br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/8e2738f4b711a5c0d2c721a3e769c3c4.js"> </script>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Here we can see some small differences such as instead of using <i>Person</i> object, we change it to <i>Mono&lt;Person&gt;</i> and for 
                <i>List&lt;Person&gt;</i>, we change it to <i>Flux&lt;Person&gt;</i>. Also, in Service <i>save</i> method we needed to call <i>block()</i> method
                in the Mono&lt;Person&gt; parameter since ReactiveMongoRepository&lt;Person, String&gt; <i>save</i> method expects us to pass a Person object. That's
                how we ask the data stream to perform a blocking action and give us the object to be saved.
            </p>
            <h3>Controller</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Spring MVC:<br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/5eb773bb3270c575c93466573efa5b0f.js"> </script>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spring WebFlux:<br/>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/fernandotnl/2ed3a657471ccaac3ce6f1484a17b965.js"> </script>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Similarly to the changes on the service layer, here we need to replace <i>ResponseEntity&lt;Person&gt;</i> for <i>Mono&lt;Person&gt;</i> and 
                <i>ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;Person&gt;&gt;</i> for <i>Flux&lt;Person&gt;</i>. Also, to make sure that we are still returning the same HTTP status code,
                we need to annotate the methods with @ResponseStatus.
            </p>
